Check the status of the repository.
Add the file you created to make a commit.

This is a command that is very often used when working with Git.  It shows us which files have been changed, which files are tracked, etc.

We can add the untracked project files to the **staging area** based on the information from the `git status` command.

At a later point, `git status` will report any modifications that we made to our tracked files before we decide to add them to the staging area again.

**git add** command to add our files to the staging area, which allows them to be tracked.

We can add a specific file to the staging area with the following command:

```bash
git add file.js
```

To add multiple files, we can do this:

```bash
git add file.js file2.js file3.js
```
